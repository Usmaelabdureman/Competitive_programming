Polycarp is an accomplished programmer, but he loves a good challenge. He recently came across an interesting problem that he needs your help with!
Given an array of n integers, nums, and an integer k, Polycarp wants to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that has a sum equal to k. 
Can you help Polycarp by implementing a function maxSubarrayLength(nums, k) that returns the maximum length of such a subarray? If there is no such subarray, 
the function should return 0 instead.
Can you impress Polycarp with your programming skills and solve this challenge?

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,1,5,-2,3], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-2,-1,2,1], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [-1, 2] sums to 1 and is the longest.

def take_input():
    length , k = map(int, input().split())
    arr  = list(map(int, input().split()))
    return  k, arr
    
    
def longest_subarray_length( arr, k ):
    # Interviewee’s code 
    Sum=0
    Store={}
    maxLen=0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        Sum=Sum+arr[i]
        if Sum==k:
            maxLen= i+1
        if (Sum-k) not in Store:
        maxLen=max(maxLen,i-mydict[sum - k])

        # if sum is not present in dictionary
        # push it in the dictionary with its index
        if sum not in mydict:
            mydict[sum] = i
    return maxLen
        





if __name__ == "__main__":
    tests = int(input())
    for _ in range(tests):
        k , arr = take_input() 
        answer =longest_subarray_length( arr, k )
        print(answer)
